                        In San Pedro, we stayed at a dive resort called Ramon's Village. We did a lot of diving on the local reef, which was about a 5-minute 
                        boatride away from Ramon's dock. Additional dive sites we explored were the Blue Hole and Half Moon Caye, which took about 2.5 hours 
                        by boat. When we weren't diving, Carter and I had fun exploring the rest of the island, and the surrounding islands.

                        I was very surprised by the number of sharks we saw while diving in Belize! Luckily they were primarily Nurse and Reef sharks, which were 
                        generally friendly and uninterested in humans. We saw lots of other types of aquatic life, including stingrays, crabs, lobsters, eels, and many types of tropical fish.

                    One morning, we took a water taxi to the nearby island Caye Caulker. Years ago, a hurricane physically split the island into a north and a south side.
                    The resulting water gap between the two sides of the island is called The Split. Here's a video of me jumping off a platform into The Split!
