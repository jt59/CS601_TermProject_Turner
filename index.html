                <p>Hello! My name is Jillian, and I recently went on a trip to Belize, Central America with my boyfriend, Carter. 
                    We flew out from Newark, New Jersey early on Saturday morning, April 23rd. We landed on the mainland in Belize City, 
                    then hopped onto a mini plan for a 14-minute ride over to the island of San Pedro. We spent a week there before flying 
                    back to the mainland to explore the Jungle Region along the Caves Branch River. We spent a few days at a Jungle Lodge 
                    near Caves Branch before flying back home on May 3rd. </p>

                <p>Carter and I got our scuba diving certifications last fall, and we were looking for a place to dive. After some online
                    research, we settled on Belize. Belize has a few world-renowned dive spotes, including Half Moon Caye and the Blue Hole. As we planned our trip,
                we learned about all the wonderful things Belize has to offer beyond scuba diving, including Mayan ruins, naturally-occuring sink-holes,
                incredible jungle wildlife, and hikable limestone caves. Another plus of Belize is that the predominant language spoken in Belize is English.
                I am not fluent in Spanish, so this made navigating a foreign country much more manageable for me.</p>
